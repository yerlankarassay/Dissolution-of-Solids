# Dissolution-of-Solids
In this experiment, we investigate the claim that there exists a universal limit to which the shape of sugar converges as it dissolves in water, irrespective of the initial form. The final shape is anticipated to be described by the power law z ‚àù R^2, we test this hypothesis by investigating the geometry of various hard-boiled candy shapes dissolving in water.
